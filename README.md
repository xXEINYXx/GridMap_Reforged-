Hi guys !
I'm EINY from france, and I want share my progress here about my Godot Addon :D
So what is the topic of my plugin ?

Gridmap ! BUT usefull one !

I gonna explain why I create this plugin, and in what case this plugin can help you in your project.

First : Why I need something different than the Gridmap node from godot Official ?
Caus The gridmap work with MeshLibrary.
From a meshlibrary you can get only the ID on the index of the cell you want, not the parameter of the mesh etc...
SOOO ! For static project that's totaly good to go with the GridMap node, but if u want some "block" animated, or in case you want play with some shaders : you definitly can't

Its WHY I work on this project.
I remake the gridmap node, that work with Instance rather than Meshlib, to have the possibility to have acces at all the instance parameter etc...

For now i've not push to far the work but i'm already proud of me, this project make me learn a lot :D
If u have any advice to give, feel free to send me some advice (simple please, i'm not a good dev, I learn by making, give me some doc or explaination of your idea <3)

Thanks in advance and I hope soon i reach my goal about this plugin !
